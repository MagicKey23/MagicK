Depend on architect system. You might need to run cc or gcc to compile

--------------LINUX and MAC----------------


1. Install editline library


--FOR ERROR--


"fatal error: editline/readline.h: No such file or directory #include <editline/readline.h>"


On Mac the editline library comes with Command Line Tools. You may still get an error about the history header not being found. In this case remove the line #include <editline/history.h>, as this header may not be required.

On Linux you can install editline with sudo apt-get install libedit-dev. On Fedora you can use the command su -c "yum install libedit-dev*"

2.LINKING Process

--SECOND ERROR--

"undefined reference to `readline'"
"undefined reference to `add_history'"

This means that you haven't linked your program to editline. This linking process allows the compiler to directly embed calls to editline in your program. 
You can make it link by adding the flag -ledit to your compile command, just before the output flag.

run this command for linking

gcc -std=c99 -Wall prompt_mac_linux.c -ledit -o prompt_mac_linux
